# Multi-objective Optimisation with DOcplex and Watson Machine Learning

This repository include accompanying code samples to the blog post [Multi-objective Optimisation with IBM ILOG CPLEX - Part 2](https://congx.dev/posts/multiobjective-optimisation-with-ibm-ilog-cplex-2/).

## Getting Started

1. Install the community desktop version for IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio from [IBM ILOG CPLEX website](https://www.ibm.com/au-en/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio).
2. Setup DOplex on your local machine per IBM's instructions
3. Clone the repository into a folder. 
3. Install the dependencies in requirements.txt
4. Run Jupyter Lab in the folder you cloned. Run the files to explore the code.

For `05-run-optimisation-job.ipynb`, you will need to have an active Watson Machine Learning instance up and running. A lite plan will do.
